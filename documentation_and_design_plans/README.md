## üìù **File Naming Convention**

All files follow this pattern:
- **Category prefix**: `01_`, `02_`, etc.
- **Descriptive name**: Clear, concise description
- **Type suffix**: `_design.md`, `_implementation.md`, `_fix.md`, etc.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

1. **Understand the project**: Read `01_project_vision_and_goals.md`
2. **Review architecture**: Check `01_architecture_designs/`
3. **Check current status**: Read `02_current_status_and_next_steps.md`
4. **Find specific features**: Browse `02_feature_designs/`
5. **Look for solutions**: Check `04_troubleshooting/` and `06_quick_references/`

## üìÖ **Documentation Maintenance**

- **Keep files updated** when implementing changes
- **Add new documents** to appropriate categories
- **Update this README** when adding new categories or files
- **Use consistent naming** for new documents
- **Link related documents** when referencing them
