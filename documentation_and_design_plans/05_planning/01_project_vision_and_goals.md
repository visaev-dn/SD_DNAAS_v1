# Lab Automation Project - Vision & Goals

## 🎯 **Our Mission**

**Transform network bridge domain management from a fragmented, manual process into a seamless, automated workflow that bridges discovery, configuration, and deployment.**

## 🌟 **The Vision**

We're building a **unified bridge domain management platform** that eliminates the gap between discovering existing network configurations and actively managing them. Our system transforms discovered bridge domains into fully editable, deployable configurations that work seamlessly with our existing builder infrastructure.

### **The Seamless Workflow:**
```
Discovery → Scan → Reverse Engineer → Edit → Deploy
    ↓        ↓         ↓              ↓      ↓
   Find BD  Parse   Create Config   Modify  Update
   Topology Config   Entry         Settings Devices
```
