# ADR-0001: Bridge Domain Editor Architecture
## 📋 **ARCHITECTURAL DECISION RECORD**

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Date**: September 24-25, 2025  
**Authors**: Development Team  
**Reviewers**: System Architects  

---

## 🎯 **CONTEXT**

We needed to choose an architecture for the Bridge Domain Editor frontend that would support:
- **524+ bridge domains** browsing and management
- **User workspace assignment** system with permissions
- **Interface editing** with DNAAS-type awareness
- **CLI integration** with backend bridge domain logic
- **Multi-user support** with conflict prevention

### **🔄 OPTIONS CONSIDERED:**

#### **Option A: Monolithic BD Editor**
- Single large component handling all BD operations
- Direct integration with discovery system
- Simple architecture but limited scalability

#### **Option B: Micro-Frontend Architecture**
- Separate applications for discovery, editing, deployment
- Complex integration but high modularity
- Over-engineered for current requirements

#### **Option C: Component-Based with User Workspace (CHOSEN)**
- Separate components for browsing, workspace, editing
- User assignment system with permission validation
- Balanced complexity with clear separation of concerns

## 🏆 **DECISION**

**We chose Option C: Component-Based Architecture with User Workspace System**

## ✅ **RATIONALE**

### **🎯 WHY COMPONENT-BASED WITH USER WORKSPACE:**

#### **✅ PROS:**
- **Clear Separation**: Each component has single responsibility
- **User Organization**: Personal workspace prevents conflicts
- **Permission System**: VLAN range validation and user attribution
- **Scalability**: Easy to enhance individual components
- **Multi-User Ready**: Assignment system supports team collaboration
- **Professional Workflow**: Enterprise-ready BD management
- **Maintainability**: Focused components easier to debug and enhance

#### **❌ CONS:**
- **Component Complexity**: More components to maintain
- **State Management**: Coordination between components required
- **Learning Curve**: Users need to understand assignment workflow

### **🎯 WHY NOT OTHER OPTIONS:**

#### **❌ Option A: Monolithic Editor**
- **Scalability Issues**: Single component would become unwieldy
- **Multi-User Problems**: No conflict prevention mechanism
- **Permission Complexity**: Hard to enforce user-based access
- **Maintenance Burden**: Large component difficult to enhance

#### **❌ Option B: Micro-Frontend**
- **Over-Engineering**: Too complex for current requirements
- **Integration Overhead**: Complex communication between apps
- **Development Complexity**: Multiple build systems and deployments
- **User Experience**: Potential inconsistencies between apps
