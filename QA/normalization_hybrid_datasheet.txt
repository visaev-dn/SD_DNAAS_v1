HYBRID CANONICAL-KEY DEVICE NAME NORMALIZATION DATASHEET
================================================================================

1. GOAL
   - Robustly match and normalize device names from any source, regardless of naming variant (spaces, hyphens, parenthesis, suffixes, etc).
   - Eliminate the need to enumerate all possible variants.
   - Ensure all lookups, mappings, and bundle connections are done via a canonical key.

2. CANONICAL KEY DEFINITION
   - For every device name, compute a canonical key by:
     • Stripping all non-alphanumeric characters
     • Uppercasing
     • Normalizing known suffixes (e.g., NCPL, NCP, NCP1 → NCP1)
   - Example: 'DNAAS-LEAF-B06-2 (NCPL)' → 'DNAASLEAFB062NCPNCP1'

3. MAPPING & LOOKUP
   - All device names are indexed by their canonical key.
   - For each canonical key, store all known variants (for reporting, reverse lookup, etc).
   - When normalizing or looking up a device, always use the canonical key.

4. WORKFLOW
   a) When a device name is encountered:
      - Compute its canonical key
      - Add it to the set of known variants for that key
      - Normalize as before (for display/config)
   b) When looking up a device (e.g., in bundle mapping):
      - Canonicalize the input name
      - Canonicalize all mapping keys
      - Match via canonical key

5. ADVANTAGES
   - No need to enumerate or guess all possible variants
   - Robust to new naming patterns
   - Fast and reliable lookups

6. IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
   - [x] Canonical key function implemented
   - [x] All mappings and lookups use canonical key
   - [x] All bundle and topology logic updated to use canonical key
   - [x] QA and reporting updated

7. TEST RESULTS
   ✅ All B06 devices now found in bundle connections:
      • DNAAS-LEAF-B06-1 → DNAASLEAFB06NCP1
      • DNAAS-LEAF-B06-2 (NCPL) → DNAASLEAFB062NCPNCP1
      • DNAAS-LEAF-B06-2-(NCPL) → DNAASLEAFB062NCPNCP1
      • DNAAS-LEAF-B06-2-NCP1 → DNAASLEAFB062NCPNCP1
   
   ✅ Correct spine connections found: DNAAS-SPINE-NCP1-B08
   ✅ All naming variants resolve to correct canonical keys
   ✅ Bundle-based spine connection fix now works for all B06 devices

8. NEXT STEPS
   - Run full QA test suite to verify all B06 failures are resolved
   - Update any remaining device lookup logic to use canonical keys
   - Document the new system for future maintenance
