# Smart Incremental Deployment Design

## Overview
A reliable, smart deployment system for edited bridge domain configurations that minimizes network disruption and ensures clean deployments in lab environments.

## Key Principles
- **Reliability First**: Lab environment priority - avoid making messes
- **Smart Change Detection**: Only deploy what actually changed
- **Parallel Deployment**: Acceptable for lab environments
- **Rollback Ready**: Generate rollback configs for user access
- **Validation Focus**: Ensure no "junk" config left behind, verify new config is fully deployed

## System Architecture

### 1. Configuration Diff Engine
```
Current Network State (from reverse-engineering) vs New Configuration = Smart Diff
```

**Components:**
- **Topology Diff**: Detect added/removed devices, VLAN changes
- **Command Diff**: Detect changed commands on existing devices
- **Impact Analysis**: Calculate scope of changes and affected devices

### 2. Deployment Strategy
**Parallel Deployment with Smart Orchestration:**
- Add new devices and configurations
- Update changed commands on existing devices
- Remove obsolete configurations
- All operations happen in parallel for speed

### 3. Validation Framework
**Multi-level validation to ensure reliability:**
- Pre-deployment: Configuration syntax and connectivity
- During deployment: Real-time progress monitoring
- Post-deployment: State verification and cleanup validation

## User Flow

### Phase 1: Configuration Edit & Preview
```
Edit Config → Generate New Topology → Preview Changes → Validate Changes
```

**Steps:**
1. User edits existing configuration using bridge domain builder
2. System generates new topology with changes via `performDryRun()`
3. System compares new vs current deployed state
4. User reviews changes in preview window

### Phase 2: Smart Deployment Preparation
```
Analyze Changes → Generate Deployment Plan → Prepare Rollback → Validate Plan
```

**Steps:**
1. **Change Analysis:**
   - Devices to be added
   - Devices to be modified
   - Devices to be removed
   - Commands that changed vs unchanged

2. **Deployment Plan Generation:**
   - Parallel execution groups
   - Dependencies and order constraints
   - Estimated execution time

3. **Rollback Preparation:**
   - Generate rollback configuration commands
   - Store current state snapshot
   - Make rollback config accessible in UI

4. **Plan Validation:**
   - Syntax validation for all commands
   - Device connectivity verification
   - Impact assessment summary

### Phase 3: Deployment Execution
```
Execute Deployment → Monitor Progress → Handle Issues → Complete Deployment
```

**Steps:**
1. **Parallel Deployment:**
   - Execute all changes simultaneously
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Log all operations

2. **Progress Monitoring:**
   - Wizard window with real-time logs
   - Progress bars for each operation
   - Device status indicators

3. **Issue Handling:**
   - Automatic error detection
   - User prompts for critical decisions
   - Continue/Retry/Abort options

4. **Completion Verification:**
   - Verify all new configurations are deployed
   - Check no obsolete configs remain
   - Validate bridge domain connectivity

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Validation
```
Verify New State → Cleanup Validation → Final Confirmation
```

**Steps:**
1. **State Verification:**
   - Confirm new configurations are active
   - Verify VLAN assignments
   - Test bridge domain connectivity

2. **Cleanup Validation:**
   - Ensure no "junk" configurations remain
   - Verify removed devices no longer have old configs
   - Check for orphaned VLANs or interfaces

3. **Final Confirmation:**
   - Success summary
   - Rollback config access
   - Deployment logs archive

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Core Components

**`SmartDeploymentManager` Class:**
```typescript
interface SmartDeploymentManager {
  analyzeChanges(currentConfig: Configuration, newConfig: Configuration): DeploymentDiff
  generateDeploymentPlan(diff: DeploymentDiff): DeploymentPlan
  prepareRollback(currentConfig: Configuration): RollbackConfig
  executeDeployment(plan: DeploymentPlan): Promise<DeploymentResult>
  validateDeployment(result: DeploymentResult): ValidationResult
}
```

**`DeploymentDiff` Interface:**
```typescript
interface DeploymentDiff {
  devicesToAdd: DeviceChange[]
  devicesToModify: DeviceChange[]
  devicesToRemove: DeviceChange[]
  unchangedDevices: string[]
  vlanChanges: VlanChange[]
  estimatedImpact: ImpactAssessment
}
```

**`DeploymentPlan` Interface:**
```typescript
interface DeploymentPlan {
  executionGroups: ExecutionGroup[]
  rollbackConfig: RollbackConfig
  estimatedDuration: number
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  validationSteps: ValidationStep[]
}
```

### 2. Integration with Existing Systems

## Summary of Recent Work and Current Status

### ✅ **Completed Tasks**

1. **Resolved Circular Import Issues**: Created `config_engine/smart_deployment_types.py` to centralize all shared dataclass definitions and enums, breaking circular dependencies between smart deployment components.

2. **Updated RollbackConfig Dataclass**: Modified the `RollbackConfig` dataclass to include:
   - `original_config_id: int` - ID of the configuration being deployed/backed up
   - `rollback_commands: List[str]` - Flat list of rollback commands
   - `created_at: str` - ISO format timestamp string
   - Made `commands` and `metadata` optional for backward compatibility

3. **Updated RollbackManager Methods**: Modified both `prepare_rollback` and `prepare_rollback_from_config` methods to:
   - Accept `config_id` parameter
   - Return `rollback_commands` as a flat list of strings instead of a device-to-commands dictionary
   - Use the new dataclass structure while maintaining backward compatibility

4. **Updated SmartDeploymentManager**: Modified `generateDeploymentPlan` and `prepareRollback` methods to:
   - Accept `config_id` parameter
   - Pass `config_id` to the rollback manager methods

5. **Updated API Server**: Modified the `/api/configurations/<int:config_id>/smart-deploy/plan` endpoint to pass `config_id` to `generateDeploymentPlan`.

6. **Verified All Imports**: Successfully tested that all components can be imported without errors:
   - `RollbackManager` ✅
   - `SmartDeploymentManager` ✅
   - `api_server` ✅

### 🔄 **Current Status**

The Smart Incremental Deployment system is now **fully integrated** at the backend level:

- **Core Infrastructure**: ✅ Complete (all Python classes and managers)

- **Rollback System**: ✅ Complete (rollback generation and management)
- **Frontend Wizard**: ✅ Complete (React component created)
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: 🔄 **Partially Complete** (wizard UI exists, but execution step not yet connected)

### 🎯 **Next Steps**

The remaining work to complete the Smart Incremental Deployment feature is:

1. **Connect Frontend Wizard Execution**: Update the frontend wizard's execution step to call the backend's smart deployment execution endpoint (`/api/configurations/<int:config_id>/smart-deploy/execute`).

2. **Real-time Progress Updates**: Implement WebSocket-based progress updates from the backend to the frontend wizard during deployment execution.

3. **Rollback Frontend Integration**: Connect the frontend wizard's rollback functionality to the backend rollback endpoint.

### 🏗️ **Architecture Status**

The system now has a **solid, well-integrated backend architecture**:

```
Frontend Wizard → API Endpoints → SmartDeploymentManager → RollbackManager/ValidationFramework
