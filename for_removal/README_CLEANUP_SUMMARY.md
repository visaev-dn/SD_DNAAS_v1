- `cli_deployer.py` - Legacy CLI deployment (no longer needed)

### **Legacy Scripts**
- `collect_complete_xml_configs.py` - Legacy XML collection (replaced by collect_lacp_xml.py)
- `map_complete_topology.py` - Legacy topology mapping (replaced by topology_discovery_v2.py)
- `parse_bundle_mapping_from_xml.py` - Legacy bundle parsing (integrated into main workflow)
- `refresh_topology_full.py` - Legacy topology refresh (replaced by comprehensive workflow)

### **Legacy Directories**
- `templates/` - Legacy Jinja2 templates (no longer used)
- `user_input/` - Legacy user input files (replaced by interactive prompts)
- `utils/` - Legacy utility modules (functionality integrated into main modules)
- `tests/` - Legacy test files (replaced by QA testing framework)
- `xml_configs/` - Legacy XML configuration storage (replaced by topology/configs/)

### **Temporary and Test Files**
- `test_*.py` - Various temporary test files created during development
- `failure_analysis_report.txt` - Temporary analysis file
- `analyze_failures.py` - Temporary analysis script
- `check_spine_connections.py` - Temporary debugging script
- `bridge_domain_g_visaev_v253.yaml` - Temporary configuration file

### **Documentation and Reports**
- `naming_inconsistency_solution.md` - Legacy documentation (replaced by NORMALIZATION_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)
- `naming_inconsistency_solution_summary.md` - Legacy summary (replaced by updated documentation)
- `workflow_report_20250713_125657.json` - Temporary workflow report
- `discover_topology.py` - Legacy topology discovery (replaced by topology_discovery_v2.py)

### **System Files**
- `.DS_Store` - macOS system file

## üîÑ What Replaced These Files

### **New Active Components**
- **`config_engine/bridge_domain_builder.py`** - Replaces builder.py, deployer.py, validator.py
- **`config_engine/device_name_normalizer.py`** - New normalization system
- **`config_engine/enhanced_topology_discovery.py`** - Enhanced topology discovery
- **`scripts/comprehensive_normalization_workflow.py`** - Complete workflow automation
- **`QA/advanced_bridge_domain_tester.py`** - Comprehensive testing framework
- **`main.py`** - Integrated interactive menu system

### **Improved Workflows**
- **Normalization System** - Handles naming inconsistencies automatically
- **Enhanced Topology Discovery** - Better device classification and mapping
- **QA Testing Framework** - Comprehensive testing with detailed reporting
- **Interactive Bridge Domain Builder** - User-friendly configuration generation

## üìä Cleanup Impact

### **Before Cleanup**
- 34+ legacy files cluttering the project
- Multiple obsolete directories
- Confusing file organization
- Mixed legacy and active code

### **After Cleanup**
- Clean, focused project structure
- Clear separation of active and legacy code
- Comprehensive documentation
- Improved maintainability

## üéØ Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Confusion** - Clear project structure
2. **Better Maintainability** - Focused on active components
3. **Improved Documentation** - Comprehensive README with file purposes
4. **Easier Onboarding** - New users can understand the project quickly
5. **Preserved History** - Legacy files available for reference

## üìù Notes

- All legacy files are preserved for reference
- No functionality was lost during cleanup
- All active features are maintained and improved
- The cleanup focused on organization and clarity

## üöÄ Current Active Project

The cleaned project now focuses on:
- **Topology Discovery** - Automated device discovery and mapping
- **Bridge Domain Configuration** - Path calculation and config generation
- **Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive testing framework
- **Normalization System** - Handling naming inconsistencies
- **Interactive Workflows** - User-friendly automation

The project is now more focused, maintainable, and user-friendly while preserving all active functionality.
